# Animal Word Conundrum

### GA WDI-25 London - Project 1:

The idea was taken from the classic Countdown conundrum game as seen on TV currently presented by Nick Hewer assisted by Rachel Riley.

This version of the conundrum has an animal theme where every conundrum is a single animal word. Each screen also has a different animal skin background implying the animal them through out the game. The word length can be determined at the start of the game henceforce providing the four difficulty levels:

* EASY = 3 to 5 letter animal words
* MEDUIM = 6 to 8 letter animal words
* HARD = 9 to 10 letter animal words
* IMPOSSIBLE = 11+ letter animal words

The game is fully responsive so you can try it on your mobile as well.

##Rules:

* Choose a difficulty level and then click PLAY to go the game.
* Click on the START button and a random jumbled up word will appear.
* You will be playing against the timer which will countdown from 20 seconds.
* If a guess is correct, the letter will turn green, and flip the word and then blank the input box ready for you to guess the next word.
* To signify a correctly guessed word you will hear a shoryuken!
* You will also get a complimentary 5 seconds added to the timer and 10 points for every word guessed correctly until the timer runs out.
* If the word is not guessed correctly then the input text will turn red and sound a buzzer for you to guess again.
* As of yet there are no clues for the more difficult words.
