# Animal Word Conundrum

### GA WDI-25 London - Project 1:

The idea was taken from the classic Countdown conundrum game as seen on TV currently presented by Nick Hewer assisted by Rachel Riley.

This version of the conundrum has an animal theme where every conundrum is a single animal word. The word length can be determined at the start of the game henceforce providing the four difficulty levels:

* EASY = 3 to 5 letter animal words
* MEDUIM = 6 to 8 letter animal words
* HARD = 9 to 10 letter animal words
* IMPOSSIBLE = 11+ letter animal words
